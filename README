I guess an introduction is in order.

Hi, I'm Atreusion, and this is my horribly written bot.

The bulk of the bot's logic is held in peregrine.py.
Files are in the files folder.
bot_container holds a bunch of boring stuff I didn't want cluttering the bot code up.

Need to pip3 install irc and passlib.
